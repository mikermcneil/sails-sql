/**
 * runNativeQuery()
 *
 * Send a native query (or template w/ bindings) to the database using the
 * provided driver and pre-existing database connection.  If an error occurs,
 * and it's because the query failed, then use database-specific error sniffing
 * to try to match that error against one of the standardized footprints, then
 * either way, attach a `footprint` property to the resulting error instance.
 * (Note that misc. errors unrelated to query failure will not necessarily have
 * a `.footprint` property.)
 *
 * > Note: This utility exists mainly because doing this sending and error
 * > negotiation by hand is a bit tedious and repetitive, even though there are
 * > two special driver methods for doing these tasks.  This way, you only have
 * > to call one thing, and it ends up being much cleaner, while still also
 * > allowing granular, low-level access to the building blocks (if desired).
